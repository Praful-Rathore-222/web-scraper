# Task:

```
So we'd likely get you to pull data from companies house and other registries, many have API's but others would need scraping.
The small task I'd like to see if you can pull all the names/roles of employees at Mambu from LinkedIn? (If not lmk we'll adjust what we aim to pull), also can you set up a free account at Traxcn and see what you can pull from their fintech section ( dont need to actual pull just see what is possible)?
